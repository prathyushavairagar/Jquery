<p>We all have heard that “meditation is good for you”. But good in what terms? Is that just reports from people doing it for 10 years, or are there good scientific studies showing specific benefits that I care about?
In this massive article I have summarized several scientific discoveries on the benefits of meditation. Over 100 studies were analyzed, and categorised the findings into 76 benefits. </p>

<p>You will noticed that on many blogs and forums when people answer the question “why should I meditate” or “what are the benefits of meditation”, they do mention a few health benefits, and spiritual benefits, but leave a lot behind; or they often lack scientific evidence backing up what they say (like this one). There are over 3,000 scientific studies on the benefits of meditation, but I have not found any blog that compiles hundreds of researches into an organized article, so I decided to fill in the gap.Some of the studies indicated that meditating even 20 minutes per day for a few weeks was already enough to start experiencing the benefits.</p>

<h2>Inner Strength for Life</h2>
<br>
<p>Our journey of growth in life can be described as a journey of developing both insights and also virtues/qualities. This article maps out what are the main qualities to develop, and what particular strengths or gifts are gained from each of them.
For some, the word “virtue” may have a bit of a Victorian puritanism associated with it. This is not my understanding of it, nor is this the spirit of this post. Rather, a virtue is a personal asset, a shield to protect us from difficulty, trouble, and suffering. Each virtue is a special sort of “power” that enables us to experience a level of well-being that we wouldn’t be able to access otherwise. Indeed, “virtue”comes from the latin virtus (force, worth, power).</p>
<p>Let’s take the virtue of equanimity as an example. Developing equanimity protects us from suffering through the ups and downs of life, and saves us from the pain of being criticized, wronged, or left behind. It unlocks a new level of well-being: the emotional stability of knowing we will always be ok.</p>

<p>Developing virtues is not about being better than others, but about developing the potential of our own heart and mind. The philosophers of ancient Greece, Buddha, the Yogis, and the Positive Psychology movement all value the cultivation of certain personal qualities. In this essay I attempt to systematize these core strengths into 12 “buckets”, as many of them share common features.Each of these virtues, rather than being an inborn personal trait, are habits and states of mind that can be consciously cultivated using a systematic approach.</p>
